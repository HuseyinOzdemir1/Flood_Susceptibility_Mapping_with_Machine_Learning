# Flood Susceptibility Mapping with the Machine Learning

Elevation, slope, aspect, curvature and precipitation were used as parameters in the training of the models. Models depending on more parameters can be created by incorporating different parameters into the work.

The seaborn library was used to examine the variation of parameters in classes and between each other.

Since the study area is very large, a susceptibility map was obtained for a small part.
